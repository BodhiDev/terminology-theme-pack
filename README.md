------------------------

The tab appearance is a WIP. If anyone with better knowledge of EDC than me wants to help, feel free to PR. Mostly, I would like to, if anyone can help:

- Remove all the useless `tab_bevel` structures and some other useless `tab_bg_*`, `tab_other_*` and `tab_shad_*` assets file.
- Add a little | separator between tabs.
- Fix a [little alignment glitch when switching tabs](http://i.imgur.com/Vok8agA.gif).
